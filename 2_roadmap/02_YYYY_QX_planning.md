# YYYY-QX - Architecture Roadmap

It would be too bad if time is spent only in making diagrams, designs and writing specifications. You need to get it done. 

A practical way to get it done is by meeting with stakeholders and project managers and make sure that the Architecture Roadmap is included in the planning. This is explained in [The Practical Process book](https://leanpub.com/practical-software-architecture) in chapter 5.

Create one of these files per month or quarter, and keep an eye on task progress.

This is an example of how you can prepare a simple Planning Table in Markdown:

| Task                  | Sprint 1      | Sprint 2 | Sprint N |
| --------------------- | ------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Extract Email module  | Team A        | Team A   |         |
| Reuse Kafka component |              | Team B   |         |
