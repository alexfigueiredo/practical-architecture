# The Practical Architecture Process - Resources

## Intro

This repository contains all the documentation templates and examples that are described in the book [The Practical Architecture Process](https://leanpub.com/practical-software-architecture). 

> This repo is work in progress.

## Contents

There are five folders in which you can find multiple markdown files. Each file has some summarized information about what you should include there.

1. Guide. An evolving set of documents explaining your Software Architecture and related topics like common patterns and operations.
2. Roadmap. The 'Make it happen' section. Includes the planning over time.
3. Designs. Each team should populate this section with new feature designs.
4. Decisions. Keep your Architecture Decision Records here. Includes the template and an example.
5. Journal. Holds meeting notes, whiteboard pictures, etc.

## The Process

The main idea of [the book](https://leanpub.com/practical-software-architecture) is that you produce these artifacts based on a collaborative, lightweight, efficient process. 

**You shouldn't hide in a corner and write all this by yourself.**

## Exporting to HTML

This repository contains a script to generate a single HTML version of the Guide. You can use this script manually or include it as part of an automated process. A good practice is to use it from a pipeline to publish a new version of this guide every time you merge a work-in-progress documentation branch into master.

The script requires that you have installed [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html).
