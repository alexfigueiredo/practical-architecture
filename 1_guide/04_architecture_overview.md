# 4. Architecture Overview

The most important part of this section should be the System Context and the Container diagrams (C1 and C2 respectively in the [C4 model](https://c4model.com/)). 

They should tell most of the story by themselves, but feel free to add some description if you need more details.

If you're starting a project from scratch, avoid including here your *Target Architecture*. This section should reflect the current status of your Architecture, not the ideal situation where you want to be (that will be placed in the *Roadmap* section). Read Chapter 5 to understand how you describe your *Roadmap*.
